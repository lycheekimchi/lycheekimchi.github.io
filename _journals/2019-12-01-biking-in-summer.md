Here is my summer evening routine: first, pick a cardinal direction. There aren't many choices. I can choose west, through the subdivision and its neatly trimmed lawns; west past the hospital and the field used for helicopter landings; south to go alongside the football field and the massively rectangular high school; and north through the city itself (if you can call it that). Regardless of my choice, all the roads (save for the highways) follow the same path: they snake outside the town of Jerseyville towards the vast expanse of farmland.

I make a choice. The decision takes half a second. It's purely arbitrary, since the scenery is all the same, but I've grown accustomed to going west; I'm fond of this stretch of perfectly straight road that bisects a perfectly flat soybean field. The next step is to get on my bike, and push my overworked legs into action once more -- soon, I'm driving my body down the country roads, shifting gears with the elevation, coasting on downhill stretches. Pedals spinning, brakes disengaged. I cut through the air.

I usually choose to go west because I'm fond of the stretch of perfectly straight road that bisects a perfectly flat soybean field; it's halfway between the outermost subdivision of Jerseyville and the farmhouse with two dogs up ahead. There's a tree at the end of the roadway that I lovingly call the Tree of Death. It sticks straight up, proud and solitary, a big green exclamation mark in the unending flatness of corn.

Getting to it is deceptively hard (hence the name Death); no matter how hard I pedal, the Tree never seems to come closer into view. It taunts me, leaves silently rustling in the wind, for minutes that stretch into hours into days. The sunlight stings my eyes, creating mirror mirages on the road ahead, and burning ghosts onto the inside of my eyelids. Next step: feel my parched throat, wonder whether my legs have always hurt this much, try to remember how long I've been here. And then, like clockwork, just when I begin to fall into despair, I'll look up, and see the Tree right above my head.

The end of the routine is to turn around once the sun sets, and the buzzing of the mosquitoes begins to growl in my ears. I pass the Tree of Death, watch Jerseyville deteriorate in reverse, and go back inside.
